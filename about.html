        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Welcome to DrugCheckMaster, your trusted partner in molecular property prediction for the pharmaceutical
            world.
            Our mission is to revolutionize the drug discovery process by providing accurate and efficient predictions
            of Lipinski properties,
            ultimately contributing to the development of safer and more effective medications.</p>



            <div class="mission">
                <h2>Mission and Values</h2>
                <p>
                    At DrugCheckMaster, our purpose is clear: we exist to empower researchers, scientists, and pharmaceutical
                    professionals with cutting-edge tools for predicting the Lipinski properties of drug candidates.
                    Lipinski's Rule of Five is a critical framework in drug development, and our app aims to streamline and
                    enhance this crucial step.
                    By doing so, we hope to accelerate the drug discovery process, reduce costs, and improve the overall success
                        rate of new drug candidates.</p>
